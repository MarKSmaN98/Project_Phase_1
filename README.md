        > Specify time period to be measured
        > Drop down for type of return (hourly, daily)

            > image area for atmosphere condition display (cloudy, windy, clear, overcast, etc)
        > Title Links - "click"
        > Fields in the bottom 2/3rds of card that populates with data for each hour

Extra Deliverables: 
        > Latitude and Longitude Form - "submit"
            >e.preventDefault (on the form itself)
